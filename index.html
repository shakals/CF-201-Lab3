            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! If you are reading this, you have found my blog! Isn't that exciting? Now I guess you'd like to
                know a little more about me. Hmm, where to begin? <br> <br>
                Well, I am a fun loving person from India currently living in the United States for the past ten years.
                I work as an application engineer for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a> and
                have thirteen years of experience in the software industry. When I am not working, I love to unwind by
                listening to a wide range of world music and spending quality time with my family. I am blessed with two
                boys, Zane and Jared aged five and one respectively. I am multilingual and can speak and understand four
                languages fluently.
                <br>
                <br>
